# TimeSeries

Forecasting the demand in future is significant because
this will make us to plan efficiently the resources
for future requirements. The observations are recorded in a
chronological order. These records are spaced with in a time
span. when plotted they exhibit a pattern or trend in a specific
direction or they are random.
Time series analysis and Logistic regression were implemented
using R language and IBM SPSS respectively.

This technical write-up focuses on experimenting
the statistical analysis of - Time series and Logistic Regression.
Prediction of future data points plays a vital role in every domain.
Be it a pandemic or a stock market historical data set, forecasting
the future range or value keeps us better prepared for the near
future and also helps in making critical business decisions. This
project is motivated to deal with two time series data sets that
is overseas trip data set , new house registration and one logistic
regression with child birth data set.
Our aim is to use six different time series modeling for
forecasting the future data set namely, Random walk, Holtâ€™s,
Naive Bayes.
In Logistic regression, Principal Component Analysis is used
as a technique to reduce the dimensions and further analyse on
the regression.
